Getting a good answer to this makes an enormous difference - I think we‚Äôve all had experiences of bringing the wrong team to a tournament and having a pretty bad weekend because of it.\nDespite this being a problem I assume everyone has though, there‚Äôs pretty much no way to find good answers. You‚Äôve got a few options:\nMake some really basic inferences about what was played last weekend (what won? what was common?) Play lots of ladder and hope that whatever you notice there translates to your tournament Look at some really basic stats online (e.g. usage rates of indiviudal or combinations of Pokemon) For a while now I‚Äôve been frustrated that there seems to be nothing better than this. VGC is a growing sport, and filled with really smart people, yet the most detail you can get on what‚Äôs being played right now is just usage rates of individual pokemon. I‚Äôm a strong believer that this is just not helpful info - how much do I care if Incineroar usage has gone up 5%? Am I likely to make any big decisions off that information? Probably not. More than that, knowing what Pokemon are getting used doesn‚Äôt even particularly tell you what your matchups will be, since knowing the context of the other Pokemon on the team is really important. For example, let‚Äôs say we find out that not only are Incineroar and Rillaboom the two most used Pokemon, but they‚Äôre also on the same team 80% of the time. That‚Äôs still not helpful information - we knew that intuitively to begin with, and the teams that those two Pokemon are on are generally defined by the 4 Pokemon that aren‚Äôt Incineroar and Rillaboom.\nOn top of the current state of Pokemon usage stats not being useful, it also just generally conflicts with the way we understand Pokemon teams. Generally in popular discourse we talk about ‚Äòcores‚Äô or ‚Äòarchetypes‚Äô - things like (speaking from a Regulation H lens here) rain, DUG, etc. And yet, no one seems to have figured out a good way to tell you what archetypes exist, and which ones you can expect to play against on a given weekend. It seems to me that having information on this would be much more valuable than what we have right now. This article is my attempt to create something that fills that gap - a data driven list of team compositions that would adequately prepare you for your next regional.\n(If you don‚Äôt care about the methodology, click here to see the current archetypes in VGC26 Regulation H)\nMethodology Data For the raw data, I downloaded the tournament results JSONs from https://pokedata.ovh/standingsVGC/. This data is complete with names, results, matchups, and open teamsheets.\nWe then need a way to transform this into something a computer can understand. The approach I took was a really simple one-hot encoding, where the rows of the final matrix were a tournament entry (i.e. a primary key of player | tournament), and the columns were binary indicators showing the presence or absence of pokemon X on team Y. It looks something like this (but with \u003e400 columns):\nPlayer Tournament Rillaboom Incineroar Spidops Mr. A Frankfurt 1 1 0 Ms. B Frankfurt 0 1 0 Mr. A Lille 0 0 1 We now have an N-length vector for each team, where N = the total number of unique Pokemon seen across the dataset, and each row contains six values of 1, with every other value at 0.\nThere‚Äôs a couple of issues with this representation:\nA lot of the columns are predictably going to end up not mattering. Intuitively, we know that there isn‚Äôt going to be a archetype in the metagame defined by (for example) Piplup, even if someone did bring it to a regional. You may or may not be surprised to learn that, particularly at the bottom end of tournaments, there are lots of Pokemon that only appear once. This is going to distract our model - we‚Äôll need a way to get rid of these This matrix is extremely sparse. Each row contains almost no information - almost every value is necessarily zero! This is bad for the geometry of our clustering and likely leaves a lot of improvement on the table. The results (as we‚Äôll see later) are ok, so I leave this to future work. For the first point, the solution for this is pretty easy - we just filter out Pokemon that appear below a certain percentage. For my testing, I find removing Pokemon that appear less than 3% of the time generally improves the modelling significantly.\nClustering Once the data is transformed and cleaned, we‚Äôre ok to start clustering. For this article, I‚Äôve used agglomerative hierarchical clustering, since I think it‚Äôs a really logical fit for the problem at hand. It works like this:\nStart by assuming every single team is its own cluster. Obviously this is not true, not in the least because many people bring exactly the same team, so; At each step, we merge together the most similar pairs of teams. At the start of the process this will be grouping together identical teams, but later we‚Äôll be merging together teams with some differences. Stop when we‚Äôve reached an appropriate number of clusters. There‚Äôs various ways to define ‚Äòappropriate‚Äô, but for this project I picked the number with the highest silhouette score for clusters counts between 2 and 20. Hopefully it‚Äôs clear what this technique does and why it was a good fit for this task. If not, here‚Äôs a good breakdown: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/hierarchical-clustering/\nArchetype Identification After clustering, there‚Äôs still a little bit of work to do before we get our final set of archetypes. To translate our data into something actionable, we need to actually pull out what ‚Äòdefines‚Äô each cluster.\nTo do this, I‚Äôve taken any Pokemon that appears in \u003e50% of the teams in its cluster to be the ‚Äòarchetype‚Äô or ‚Äòcore‚Äô we‚Äôre concerned about. Additionally, if an archetype appears in \u003c1% of teams, I‚Äôve eliminated that entirely, as it likely isn‚Äôt a great descriptor of the metagame.\nAfter doing these steps, we get a realistic and clearly interpretable set of team compositions. Time to take a look!\nResults Before we break down the clusters one by one, here‚Äôs a graph showing them in 2D space. You can see the names and Pokemon of each cluster on the right. Each dot here represents a real team that was played in Milwaukee \u0026 Belo Horizonte regionals. You can hover over them to see the player name, their full team, and their record. See if you can try find yourself!\n(Note: different to what you might be used to, the x and y axes don‚Äôt particularly ‚Äòmean‚Äô anything here, at least not on purpose - they are just the two most informative dimensions onto which we can project these points. Exercise for you as the reader: see if you can try interpret them!)\nNow to meet the teams!\nArchetype 1: Incineroar, Basculegion-Male, Pelipper, Archaludon e.g. Fabio Lima‚Äôs Belo Horizonte t8 team: https://pokepast.es/5852fc44e449d877\nProbably the most archetype-y archetype out there. One interesting point here is that Basculegion is now firmly considered part of this archetype - I imagine if we did the same analysis in 2025, that might not be the case.\nArchetype 2: Gholdengo, Sneasler, Rillaboom, Ninetales-Alola, Ursaluna-Bloodmoon e.g. Alex Arand‚Äôs Milwaukee 1st place team: https://pokepast.es/498a1a5967851380\nIf you‚Äôve been following the metagame at all, you won‚Äôt be surprised to see this team come up first. What might be a surprise is it‚Äôs got 5 Pokemon - it turns out people are swapping out the fire type on the team more than I‚Äôd thought (which you can see represented as different clumps on the graph!), e.g. lots of Arcanine-Hisui appearing in the 4-4 range.\nArchetype 3: Sneasler, Indeedee-Male, Tyranitar e.g. Erich Schrader‚Äôs Milwaukee t16 team: https://pokepast.es/da8f52d70b02271b\nThere‚Äôs a few teams in this mold - the paste that did well in last year‚Äôs Toronto team, Nils Dunlop‚Äôs old sand team, and others.\nArchetype 4: Gholdengo, Amoonguss, Porygon2, Incineroar, Ursaluna e.g. Jean Lopez‚Äô Belo Horizonte t32 team: https://pokepast.es/022a5974ab910956\nClassic Reg H trick room balance! The main variations of this include Kilowattrel and Sneasler, but other Pokemon show up too.\nArchetype 5: Indeedee-Female, Torkoal, Ursaluna e.g. Tom Hayden‚Äôs Milwaukee t128 team: https://pokepast.es/8a787b7aac5f60ea\nHard trick room! These seem to be the 3 Pokemon that are always around - in classic HTR fashion there‚Äôs a lot of variance here. It‚Äôs worth noting that this archetype is performing pretty badly despite its high usage - it is pretty hard to find these in day 2.\nArchetype 6: Sneasler, Volcarona, Rillaboom, Kingambit e.g. Jerry Woods III‚Äôs Milwaukee t128 team: https://pokepast.es/5ec7f2641a888942\nThis balance archetype has a lot more usage at lower records. It also covers significant variance - most of the teams in this cluster have 3/4 of the headline Pokemon, rather than all 4.\nArchetype 7: Gholdengo, Tyranitar, Garchomp e.g. Adit Selvaraj‚Äôs Milwaukee t32 team: https://pokepast.es/7c904717e797fcde\nThis stuck out to me a lot, and I‚Äôm imagining will stick out to lots of other people too! This cluster is fairly low usage, and typically looks like hyper-offense, with one of 3 different tailwind setters on the team. It‚Äôs also another one where we typically see 2/3 of the headline mons on the team at once, rather than all 3.\nArchetype 8: Incineroar, Dragonite, Ninetales-Alola, Kingambit e.g. Dylan Matthews‚Äô Milwaukee 4th place team: https://pokepast.es/9b656262d9ee55a9\nI‚Äôm not tapped in enough to know where this has come from, but the above paste got a lot of usage this weekend!\nWhat next? I think the results above actually describe the state of the metagame fairly well. There‚Äôs a few things missing though:\nThe idea of ‚Äòbalance‚Äô isn‚Äôt captured very well here. DUG is a pretty glaring omission to me, as is Sneasler + Electabuzz/Magmar. I think this is because ‚ÄòBalance‚Äô is generally quite vague and a lot of the spots on the teams are pretty interchangeable. Nonetheless, I think the gold star version of this project would be able to capture that in some way. The geometry of my representation here isn‚Äôt very nice, and I think that shows on the TSNE plot. I am 90% certain this is due to the sparsity of the representation (where each row has 6 1s and 300+ 0s). I think the biggest improvements would come from finding a more efficient and informative representation Lots of archetypes aren‚Äôt just defined by Pokemon, but moves and abilities too. For example, a feature for ‚ÄòTailwind‚Äô or even something more vague like ‚ÄòRedirection‚Äô might lead to more interpretable clusters. More than anything though, my real motivation for sharing this is to hopefully spark some more creativity within the Pokemon community when it comes to preparation and data science. The full working code for this project can be found here, and I strongly encourage anyone interested to try improve on this! I likely won‚Äôt have time to do it myself, so all help is appreciated.\nThanks for reading! I hope this was useful, if not interesting.\n","wordCount":"1870","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2025-10-26T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-10-26T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Darcy McCarthy"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vgc-clustering/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Pond üê∏","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="The Pond üê∏ (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Pond üê∏</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

One interesting point here is that Basculegion is now firmly considered part of this archetype - I imagine if we did the same analysis in 2025, that might not be the case.</p><h3 id=archetype-2-gholdengo-sneasler-rillaboom-ninetales-alola-ursaluna-bloodmoon>Archetype 2: Gholdengo, Sneasler, Rillaboom, Ninetales-Alola, Ursaluna-Bloodmoon<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#archetype-2-gholdengo-sneasler-rillaboom-ninetales-alola-ursaluna-bloodmoon>#</a></h3><p><em>e.g. Alex Arand&rsquo;s Milwaukee 1st place team: <a href=https://pokepast.es/498a1a5967851380>https://pokepast.es/498a1a5967851380</a></em></p><p>If you&rsquo;ve been following the metagame at all, you won&rsquo;t be surprised to see this team come up first. What might be a surprise is it&rsquo;s got 5 Pokemon - it turns out people are swapping out the fire type on the team more than I&rsquo;d thought (which you can see represented as different clumps on the graph!), e.g. lots of Arcanine-Hisui appearing in the 4-4 range.</p><h3 id=archetype-3-sneasler-indeedee-male-tyranitar>Archetype 3: Sneasler, Indeedee-Male, Tyranitar<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#archetype-3-sneasler-indeedee-male-tyranitar>#</a></h3><p><em>e.g. Erich Schrader&rsquo;s Milwaukee t16 team: <a href=https://pokepast.es/da8f52d70b02271b>https://pokepast.es/da8f52d70b02271b</a></em></p><p>There&rsquo;s a few teams in this mold - the paste that did well in last year&rsquo;s Toronto team, Nils Dunlop&rsquo;s old sand team, and others.</p><h3 id=archetype-4-gholdengo-amoonguss-porygon2-incineroar-ursaluna>Archetype 4: Gholdengo, Amoonguss, Porygon2, Incineroar, Ursaluna<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#archetype-4-gholdengo-amoonguss-porygon2-incineroar-ursaluna>#</a></h3><p><em>e.g. Jean Lopez&rsquo; Belo Horizonte t32 team: <a href=https://pokepast.es/022a5974ab910956>https://pokepast.es/022a5974ab910956</a></em></p><p>Classic Reg H trick room balance! The main variations of this include Kilowattrel and Sneasler, but other Pokemon show up too.</p><h3 id=archetype-5-indeedee-female-torkoal-ursaluna>Archetype 5: Indeedee-Female, Torkoal, Ursaluna<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#archetype-5-indeedee-female-torkoal-ursaluna>#</a></h3><p><em>e.g. Tom Hayden&rsquo;s Milwaukee t128 team: <a href=https://pokepast.es/8a787b7aac5f60ea>https://pokepast.es/8a787b7aac5f60ea</a></em></p><p>Hard trick room! These seem to be the 3 Pokemon that are always around - in classic HTR fashion there&rsquo;s a lot of variance here. It&rsquo;s worth noting that this archetype is performing pretty badly despite its high usage - it is pretty hard to find these in day 2.</p><h3 id=archetype-6-sneasler-volcarona-rillaboom-kingambit>Archetype 6: Sneasler, Volcarona, Rillaboom, Kingambit<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#archetype-6-sneasler-volcarona-rillaboom-kingambit>#</a></h3><p><em>e.g. Jerry Woods III&rsquo;s Milwaukee t128 team: <a href=https://pokepast.es/5ec7f2641a888942>https://pokepast.es/5ec7f2641a888942</a></em></p><p>This balance archetype has a lot more usage at lower records. It also covers significant variance - most of the teams in this cluster have 3/4 of the headline Pokemon, rather than all 4.</p><h3 id=archetype-7-gholdengo-tyranitar-garchomp>Archetype 7: Gholdengo, Tyranitar, Garchomp<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#archetype-7-gholdengo-tyranitar-garchomp>#</a></h3><p><em>e.g. Adit Selvaraj&rsquo;s Milwaukee t32 team: <a href=https://pokepast.es/7c904717e797fcde>https://pokepast.es/7c904717e797fcde</a></em></p><p>This stuck out to me a lot, and I&rsquo;m imagining will stick out to lots of other people too! This cluster is fairly low usage, and typically looks like hyper-offense, with one of 3 different tailwind setters on the team. It&rsquo;s also another one where we typically see 2/3 of the headline mons on the team at once, rather than all 3.</p><h3 id=archetype-8-incineroar-dragonite-ninetales-alola-kingambit>Archetype 8: Incineroar, Dragonite, Ninetales-Alola, Kingambit<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#archetype-8-incineroar-dragonite-ninetales-alola-kingambit>#</a></h3><p><em>e.g. Dylan Matthews&rsquo; Milwaukee 4th place team: <a href=https://pokepast.es/9b656262d9ee55a9>https://pokepast.es/9b656262d9ee55a9</a></em></p><p>I&rsquo;m not tapped in enough to know where this has come from, but the above paste got a lot of usage this weekend!</p><h2 id=what-next>What next?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-next>#</a></h2><p>I think the results above actually describe the state of the metagame fairly well. There&rsquo;s a few things missing though:</p><ul><li>The idea of &lsquo;balance&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t captured very well here. DUG is a pretty glaring omission to me, as is Sneasler + Electabuzz/Magmar. I think this is because &lsquo;Balance&rsquo; is generally quite vague and a lot of the spots on the teams are pretty interchangeable. Nonetheless, I think the gold star version of this project would be able to capture that in some way.</li><li>The geometry of my representation here isn&rsquo;t very nice, and I think that shows on the TSNE plot. I am 90% certain this is due to the sparsity of the representation (where each row has 6 1s and 300+ 0s). I think the biggest improvements would come from finding a more efficient and informative representation</li><li>Lots of archetypes aren&rsquo;t just defined by Pokemon, but moves and abilities too. For example, a feature for &lsquo;Tailwind&rsquo; or even something more vague like &lsquo;Redirection&rsquo; might lead to more interpretable clusters.</li></ul><p>More than anything though, my real motivation for sharing this is to hopefully spark some more creativity within the Pokemon community when it comes to preparation and data science. The full working code for this project can be found <a href=https://github.com/darcyjfmccarthy/poliboard/blob/master/Reg%20H%20Clusters.ipynb>here</a>, and I strongly encourage anyone interested to try improve on this! I likely won&rsquo;t have time to do it myself, so all help is appreciated.</p><p>Thanks for reading! I hope this was useful, if not interesting.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/data-science/>Data Science</a></li><li><a
